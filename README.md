# TCTest â€” a tiny unit test framework for C

TCTest is a tiny unit test framework for C.  It consists of two files [tctest.h](tctest.h) and [tctest.c](tctest.c).  It is distributed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).  It has been developed and tested using Linux, but should work on other Posix-compliant operating systems.

## Concepts

TCTest is modeled on [JUnit 4](https://junit.org/junit4/).

The test program should define a `TestObjs` data type (typically a typedef for a struct type.)  An instance of `TestObjs` is the test fixture, i.e., the objects/data being tested.

The test program should define `setup` and `cleanup` functions.  The `setup` function creates a new instance of `TestObjs`, and is run automatically before each test.  The `cleanup` function destroys an instance of `TestObjs`, and is run automatically after each test.

Test functions take a pointer to an instance of `TestObjs` as a parameter.  They use the `ASSERT` macro to make assertions about expected behavior.  TCTest installs a signal handler for common runtime exceptions such as segfault and floating-point exception, and considers these as test failures.

Test functions are executed using the `TEST` macro.  All invocations of the `TEST` macro should be surrounded by calls to the `TEST_INIT` and `TEST_FINI` macros.  *Important*: the test program must call `TEST_INIT`, `TEST`, and `TEST_FINI` from its `main` function.

## Limitations

Because C is a memory-unsafe language, the execution of test functions can't be made truly independent from each other, and it is possible that the behavior of a later test function could be affected by the invocation of an earlier one.  To make testing more robust, you can execute a separate test program process for each test function.  (See the description of `tctest_testname_to_execute` in the [advanced features](#advanced-features) section, and also the [demo program](demo.c).)

## Demo program

The demo program [demo.c](demo.c) shows how to write a test program using TCTest.  The expected output of the demo program is

```
testPush...passed!
testPushMany...failed assertion !stackPush(objs->s, 11) at line 130
testSwapTopElts...segmentation fault (most recent assertion at line 140)
testSizeIsEven...floating point exception (most recent assertion at line 152)
3 test(s) failed
```

## "Advanced" features

There are a few "advanced" features you might find useful.

The `FAIL` macro can be used to immediate fail the current test.  The macro argument is a message describing the failure.  Using this macro is slightly nicer than doing something like `ASSERT(0)`.

If the `tctest_testname_to_execute` variable is set to point to a C string, only the test function with the name specified by the string will be executed.  This is useful for allowing the test program to take a command line argument specifying the specific test to run.  [demo.c](demo.c) is set up this way.

If the `tctest_on_test_executed` function pointer is set to a non-null value, the specified function will be called by the `TEST` macro after each test function has been executed. The function will be passed the name of the test (as a C string) and a boolean value indicating whether or not the named test passed.  [demo.c](demo.c) shows how to use this feature.

If the `tctest_on_complete` function pointer is set to a non-null value, the specified function will be called by `TEST_FINI` after all tests have been executed.  This can be useful if the test program needs to do some specialized reporting of test results.  [demo.c](demo.c) shows how to use this feature.
